# Express and MongoDB E-Commerce Example

## Course Material
[Set up express web backend and mongodb database](https://mammothclub.com/course/set-up-express-web-backend-and-mongodb-database-1)

## Required Tech
(Outside of your standard IDE, CLI, etc.)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Install Order
1. ```npm init```
2. ```npm install express```
3. ```npm i mongodb```
4. ```npm i --save-dev nodemon```
    a. ```--save-dev``` allows the package to be used in the dev environment, but will not be deployed in the production environment.
5. ```npm i --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/node```

## Final Verdict
This course was also trash. It ended in the middle of the course. Not sure if I'm not getting full access to these things or what, but FFS. It gave me a certificate before I could even connect a real database to the project. Need proof? Here it is: [Certificate on 8/5/25](/Certificate_2025-08-05.png). <br />
On to the next one, I guess.
